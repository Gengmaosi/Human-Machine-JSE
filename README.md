# Note for the reliable libraries
In the initial version, our experiment was built and tested on Python=3.7, psychopy==2022.1.4, fitter==1.5.2, pandas==1.1.3, and numpy==1.19.5. However, during recent testing, we found that there were errors when installing Python=2022.1.4 library in Python 3.7 environment, possibly due to version update iterations. Thus, we have provided the library version that can run smoothly in the Python 3.8 environment in requirements.txt for your reference (until 2023/11). In summary, please ensure that the libraries in right versions such as psycopy, filter, pandas, and numpy are installed correctly before running the program.
